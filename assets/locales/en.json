    "story": {
      "p1": "I loved Japan. The atmospheric streetscapes, hot springs that heal mind and body, local cuisine, and warm people. Someday, traveling throughout this beloved Japan was my dream.",
      "p2": "However, the reality was that of a busy salaryman. Extended vacations were a pipe dream, and I told myself that 'touring Japan would be a pleasure for retirement' and was almost giving up.",
      "p3": "Then came a turning point that would change my life 180 degrees. It was my infection with the novel coronavirus.",
      "p4": "Alone, isolated in a room for a week. In a situation facing the fear of death, only one thought crossed my mind: 'If I want to do something, I must do it now or I'll regret it. Life is far too short.'",
      "p5": "The day I could leave my room, my second life began. In just one week of isolation, I had finished planning everything needed to build my own camper.",
      "p6": "Selecting the base vehicle, designing a slide bed for a family of four, arranging a desk for work, identifying requirements for 8-number registration to meet regulations, building a sub-battery system, and even sourcing wood for the interior. The blueprint in my head was completely finished.",
      "p7": "I immediately bought a 2008 HiAce Super Long (same size as an ambulance!) for 1.7 million yen. From there, for two months, I devoted all available time to DIY - after work on weekdays, weekends, and breaks during remote work.",
      "p8": "And then came the summer vacation I had been aiming for. Before the first car camping trip with my family, the one-of-a-kind original camper was finally completed.",
      "p9": "That trip was unimaginably moving. Passing by fully booked hotels, experiencing the excitement of Aomori Nebuta Festival and Nagaoka Fireworks Festival on the front lines. In summer Hokkaido, we enjoyed nature for 10 days without worrying about skyrocketing accommodation costs, surrounded by our children's beaming smiles.",
      "p10": "Through this experience, I became convinced: 'Can one vehicle enrich life to this extent?'",
      "p11": "And this free journey gave me the next dream I would stake my life on. That is, to make this camper a 'development base for traveling the world,' creating new value while interacting with cultures and people around the world, without being bound by location.",
      "p12": "Specifically, developing innovative applications using AI technology and delivering them to users worldwide through the Apple platform. Pouring inspiration gained from travels into development in real-time, making people's lives more convenient and enriched. I found this form of contribution.",
      "p13": "Dreams I had almost given up on as a salaryman. But in this one life, I don't want to have any more regrets. Travel the world, create value, and fully enjoy encounters. And someday, when I face the end of my life, I want to smile from my heart saying 'It was the best life.' 'TrailfusionAI' is the name of that oath."
